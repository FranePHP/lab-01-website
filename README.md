This rep is used for practice purposes

There will be more of these

Couple a days ago a made 2 commits and then 
pushed them to this repository

Alas that resulted in some type of error and
I got 2 master branches?!

Today I made another commit and
pushed it to this directory and
All worked well

Looks like problem was in uploading files through
GitHub via Upload button directly
Something went wrong there
